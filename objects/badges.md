# [Badges]

Example [Badges]

[Badges] bring order to the [DIMO] knowledge graph, by verifying the capabilities of [projects]. They can also represent real-world claims from regulatory or certification [orgs].

[Badges] are inherited from sub-components of a [Project], [Function], or [Device].

**Badge Types**

For example, if you have a [device] with a “Network Dependency’ badge that is included in a certain [function] (say, a Smart Lock), and the [function]+[Device] combination is used in a specific project, DIMO will assign the “Network Dependency” badge to that project to indicate that a specific [function] included in that project will not work if there is no network connection.

#### [Project] Badges - Seed, Sapling TREE
[Projects] are designed and built to different capability levels based on the basemap data, functionality available, and testing/verification performed.

Digital Infrastructure Inc. uses [badges] to certify all zones carrying commercial traffic on our network. We have developed a simple badging framework to describe how a project should function at each stage in a robotics project:

<table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th>Stage</th> <th>Functionality </th></tr> <tr><td>[Seed] </td> <td>Read-only - capable of supporting simple wayfinding applications or non-critical information gathering tasks. Useful for ODD compatibility research and site planning.</td></tr> <tr><td>[Sapling]</td> <td>Read-write capable [projects] - capable of supporting operational tasks according to predefined parameters. Useful for operational testing prior to commercial deployment. </td></tr> <tr><td>[TREE] Trusted Robotics Execution Environment </td> <td>Realtime digital twin capable of supporting high-uptime safety-critical applications. Monitoring infrastructure capable of verifying successful mission completion.</td></tr></tbody></table>


### [Zone] Badges
[Projects] that take place in a specific geographic area, or [Zone] inherit the [Badge] requirements of that zone. For example, AV projects in [Zone] California need to apply for a [Badge] permit from the [Org] California DMV in order to user [Device] Autonomous Vehicle in [Function] Public Ridehailing.


### [Device] Badges



### [Badge] [Tasks]
Certain [badges] require effort, expertise, or existing certification. An [org] or person can pay for the necessary verification of integration work required. We have existing task templates set up to achieve this:

- GTFS -RT Feed Set up with monitoring
- Smart Contract Audit
- Device Integration into IoT or Dispatch hub for multiple different [Orgs]
- Home Assistant
- Joyride
- EasyMile
