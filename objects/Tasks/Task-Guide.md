# [Task] 

A [Task] is a reusable description of some work that needs to be completed. [Tasks] can be generated by [Functions] or they can be created directly by DIMO users with verified accounts for ad-hoc requests. 





## [Task] Directory
Step-by-step guide on how to complete individual [tasks]


### [Complete a FOIA/FOIL Request](https://airtable.com/tblIc1j1lbieDf9sd/viwBNg045cwy1fK3Q/recBV9zez4bcNWMmi?blocks=hide) 
1.	Find key details 
- Name of deal or project – can do through a google search using some keywords (name of city, type of project, organizations related to project, whatever information you have, etc..)
- Dates – similarly look for dates of project
- Public Agencies involved – start with the town/city government and then go to state government 	
2.	Learn what information is important to gather
- What documents are needed:
	- 	RFP/RFI/RFQ, signed contracts, winning submittal proposals, etc..
- Is there a certain metric that is important and being looked for:
	- Pricing, number of [device], types of services rendered, general details, etc…
3.	Requesting RFP
- If you are only searching for a small number of RFPs then may be more efficient to call up the public agency and discuss the process so you know what to do and don’t waste time
	- If this isn’t possible then proceed to following steps
- Check to see if they have a formalized process, could be one of:
	- Fill-in form that needs to be faxed
  - Online form to fill out
  - If not then proceed to following 
- Find associated emails or points of contact within public agencies
	- Use email template below
  - If unsure of which public agency is responsible then message all government parties that could be involved (town/city, state)
4.	DIMO Knowledge Graph
- When a FOIA/FOIL request is granted and you receive information or documentation please see ‘importing [deal] information’ under [task] to fill out appropriately
5.	Miscellaneous
- Some might require some sort of payment, this will be baked into the cost of attaining information
