# Building Knowledge Graph Credentials

[DIMO] is designed to unlock creativity at all layers in a [project]. A critical aspect of this is making it possible for anyone to contribute and get recognized for their work.


#### Creating & Verifying an Account
Anyone with an internet connection and a github account can contribute directly to a project or to the DIMO documentation, but to access badges and build a reputation score you need to create a DIMO account


#### New User Account Signup
Complete this form, and add detail to your account by linking existing credentials.


#### Becoming a Curator
The best way to build some credibility in the DIMO knowledge graph is to contribute to it.

We’ve set up a series of choose-your-own-adventure missions to get you familiar with the DIMO network graph.

It’s divided into 20 minute chunks - you can typically finish the first three exercises within an hour. After the 3rd stage your work will be submitted to an admin for approval

Fill out this form. If approved, you’ll be able to submit changes to the Knowledge Graph, and participate in the [Tasks] marketplace.


### Step 1 - Join Community, Read Docs
- Read the [DIMO Knowledge Graph Onboarding] (You’re doing that now).
- Create an account on Dimo.zone and join our Discord. Link your Discord username to your DIMO account to Link your status and permissions.
- If you want to receive tokens for contributions (and who doesn’t??!) Sign up for Metamask and add your address to your [person] or [org] account by copying it as pictured.

### Step 2 - Explore Knowledge Graph & Projects
- Familiarize yourself with the DIMO Knowledge Graph Onboarding Document (You’re reading it now), adding any questions as comments.
- Look through some of the template projects, functions, [devices], and [organizations] on the platform.
- See anything missing? Create a [task] to add some new data: [Link enables a user to submit requests for new entries to the knowledge graph, before they’re granted edit permissions to make changes themselves]

### Step 3 - Get your First [Badge] By Completing or Funding a [Task]
This is a list of [Tasks] that are good to get started with if you’re new to DIMO. Choose one from the “Unassigned” list and get busy! Some of these tasks also carry token awards too, and you can filter down to see only those tasks.
There are also a few ongoing tasks that anyone can do anytime. Here’s one:

- Read the overview of [Events] included above and - add an event and associate it with an [org], [project], or [function] we already have on the DIMO platform. Choose something you’re interested in.
- Are you a TSLA fan? Pull in some information about their product announcements, or the [Boring Company] tunnels in Las Vegas.
- Upset about how long the I5 widening is taking (or upset that it’s even happening..) add a project update and tag [LA Metro] and [CalTrans].


#### Creating and Funding a [Task]
Long on cash but short on time? You can build out any part of the graph by funding a task!

Many tasks already have templates supported by instructional Loom videos that can be repurposed for any domain.


### Step 4 - Invite a Team and Start Building a [Project] together
Hopefully once you have your first DIMO contribution [badge] assigned to your account you have started to think of a couple of [Projects] that you’d like to add.

- Invite a friend or 10 to the Discord - it’s more fun to build DIMO with other people who are interested in the same things. If you are here on behalf of an organization, you can build a knowledge graph with your colleagues.
- Once they’ve joined, make sure they fill out this form so your accounts are linked. Now you can build together.
