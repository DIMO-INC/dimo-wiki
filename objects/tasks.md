# [Tasks] 
While building out projects and attaching them to the DIMO graph, you’ll frequently come across ideas for data sources that would be useful to add.

We’re tracking a running list of “Requests for Graph Data” [Here].

Examples of [event] streams that originated as [Graph Requests]:
 - The location and status of all the Tesla Superchargers in the world, including the number of plugs, available power, and available amenities”
- All of the commercially available robots that run on ROS, including the version, [type] of robot and cost (if available).
- All NHTSA Projects tracked in the AV TEST platform

Adding a [Task] or [Graph Request] creates an [event] when it’s accepted, and when the data/feed is actually published to the knowledge graph, payment or [badges] are issued according to the original agreement.

#### [Task] Templates:

- These are all of the [[tasks] we've confirmed](https://airtable.com/shrWuPpuUlE3MaTMy) that we're going to offer to members on our platform, including the base price we'll charge. Users will also be able to request any arbitrary [[tasks]](https://airtable.com/shr5ydIkHvmPUTN5E).

There are other ad-hoc [tasks] we're tracking that we've funded through Digital Infrastructure Services: 

- [Task]: [pull in the top 40 Infrastructure [projects] in the US](https://airtable.com/tblIc1j1lbieDf9sd/viwLhWQxSIbpvb6P9/recnVKuiC8uElP0cx) (at least as of 2017...)

- [Task]: pull in all of the [NHTSA-regulated AV [projects] ](https://airtable.com/shrARtAvT79gV3Dnj)

- [Task]: Maintain a list of all of the [Members of PAVE](https://airtable.com/shrTj2vbAH2CXKEY9) - a target AV industry group
