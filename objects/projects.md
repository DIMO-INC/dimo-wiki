# [Projects] 



The whole point of DIMO is to enable [Projects] that move things around. [Projects] are systems of [orgs], [people], [functions], [devices] that are designed to achieve a measurable outcome. [Deals] are a specific type of [function] that can be used to fund and build [projects] by specifying [tasks] that need to be completed to successfully launch a new instance of a [project]. 

Here’s an example of current and potential [projects] that we’re tracking.

[Projects] can be assigned type tags, which helps them show up for the correct users at the right time.

DIMO also has a built-in [function] that can be used to build a sub-graph of [projects] linked to other [objects] for research purposes. [You can submit a request here.](https://airtable.com/shr4xlviISJd52GM6)

Here's an example list of Spot Robotics Projects:

Or this list of NHTSA Regulated Automated Vehicle Projects:

Like all DIMO [objects] a [Project] can either be a "template" or an "instance"

[Orgs] and [People] can create [Project] Templates to <a href="https://airtable.com/shroBTjnjbWRyb0gh" target="_blank">display their capabilities.</a>

## Examples of DIMO Graph-Building Projects
  
[[Events](https://airtable.com/shryKKrkt7g5DZl9y)] we're tracking. You can filter based on your interest to get lists like: 

- Elon Musk List (Tesla + Boring Company + SpaceX) Project [Events]
- Waymo Project [Events]
- [Projects] coming up for Bid Soon (or past projects that you can FOIA) 

- Public Agency [[Deal]](https://airtable.com/shrzktHuYjqpQMfHf) & [[Project](https://airtable.com/shrhVLXNuwWrt72rt)] Gallery pages. We're going to be building these out significantly.

## [Zones]
Live [projects] typically contain one or more references to physical locations that can be defined by addresses, zip codes, geo-JSON - these can be home to one or more [projects], and can be set up with administrative structures that are managed by [people]

## [Project] Instances
Combinations of [Project Templates] and [Zones]

A [Project Instance] must be associated with at least one [Zone], and inherits the policies of that [zone].
