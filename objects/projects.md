# [Projects] 



The whole point of DIMO is to enable [Projects] that move things around. [Projects] are systems of [orgs], [people], [functions], [devices] that are designed to achieve a measurable outcome. [Deals] are a specific type of [function] that can be used to fund and build [projects] by specifying [tasks] that need to be completed to successfully launch a new instance of a [project]. 

Here’s an example of current and potential [projects] that we’re tracking.

[Projects] can be assigned type tags, which helps them show up for the correct users at the right time.

DIMO also has a [function]( that enables the custom creation of lists of [projects] like this list of Spot Robotics Projects:

Or this list of NHTSA Regulated Robotics Projects:

Like most other DIMO [objects], [Projects] can either be a "template" or an "instance"

[Orgs] and [People] can create [Project] Templates to [display their capabilities.](https://airtable.com/shroBTjnjbWRyb0gh)

### [Zones]
Live [projects] typically contain one or more references to physical locations that can be defined by addresses, zip codes, geo-JSON - these can be home to one or more [projects], and can be set up with administrative structures that are managed by [people]

### [Project] Instances
Combinations of [Project Templates] and [Zones]

A [Project Instance] must be associated with at least one [Zone], and inherits the policies of that [zone].
