# [Events]
The knowledge graph to track [events] and associate them with their subjects & participants.

#### Prediction

An event can contain a statement from a [Person] or [Org] that references some time-bound information. For example -

![media_icon.png](/media_icon.png) ![funding_icon.png](/funding_icon.png) ![partnership_icon.png](/partnership_icon.png) ![product-launch_icon.png](/product-launch_icon.png) ![prediction_icon.png](/prediction_icon.png) ![mapupdate_icon.png](/mapupdate_icon.png)

A claim can be about project or financial performance:
- Want to see how often [Tesla] [GM] [Ford] have hit their production targets? Are their targets aggressive compared to each other?
- Which [Orgs] claim they’ll be able to offer automated delivery services at less than $1/mile by 2025?

Or - the “Claims” can be credentials issued by regulators to [Orgs],[People],[Projects],[Devices], or even [Functions]. Certain claims from verified accounts can be used to issue [badges]:

**- [California] [DMV] issued a [fully driverless] [permit] to [AutoX] on [September 20, 2020]**

One other common type of claim [event] is a “Billable” [event]. It can be submitted using a dedicated form that creates an [event] that gets assigned to the billing admin of a [project] or [task].

### [Event] Streams
There are many high-quality, reliable public [event] streams available today.

here are some we’ve compiled from publicly available sources:
- [Tesla Supercharger] [Status] (RSS Feed)
- [OSM] [Status]
- Transit Feeds

All [DIMO]-produced [Event] feeds are available as RSS, email, updates, or through our API with a paid account.

Don’t see a stream you need? Check out our [task] board to see if someone is working on it already, and submit a new [Task] request if it’s not on our roadmap.
