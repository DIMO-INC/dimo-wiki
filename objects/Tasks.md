# [Tasks]
All [Tasks] are generated by a [Function] 

[Functions] contain multiple underlying [tasks] that describe narrowly focused services with measurable results. 

The ‘Budget a [Project]’ [Function] contains these [tasks]:
- [Project] Scoping - defining the performance targets for a [project], 
- [Project] Staffing - Identifying personnel needs for the [project]
- Financial modeling - building a financial model to understand the sensitivities in revenue and costs of the [project]
- Delivery - Attaching this information to the [project] and [org] objects in the DIMO graph, preparing it to be “published” after it is presented to the client who called the function originally.  

**There are 2 types of [Tasks] - Templates and Instances**

[Task] Templates are generic example [Tasks] that are attached to [Functions].
These [Tasks] contain Specific Instructions on how to complete the requirements of a function from start to finish, and they contain dependencies on the other steps (First do this, then do that…) 
When a function is called it generates an [event] that creates a set of [tasks] that are copies of the template with specific information about that instance of the [function].
[Task] Directory
[Tasks] are assigned to an [org] or [person] to complete   
Individual [tasks] can have a pricing formula ($/hour) or fixed price
[Tasks] instances are linked with [events] that tie them to the original [function] and [task] template that created them.
