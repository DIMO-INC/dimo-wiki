[DIMO] is designed to help all types of [people] and [orgs] build [projects]. 

We try to make it possible for anyone to receive or contribute value quickly based on their skill set or needs. 

This quick onboarding process will 

## Step 1 - Join the DIMO Community
Anyone with an internet connection and a github account can create new [projects] within DIMO. 

You can also suggest contributions directly to existing [[projects]](/objects/projects) or even to code that runs DIMO itself.

To access the marketplace, earn [badges] and build a reputation score you need to create a DIMO account.

### New Account Setup
Request an account [here](https://airtable.com/shrIckHHTgnv1sSo4) for a [person] or [org] 
Once approved, you can [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/fZxrurPHZh). Say hi, and we'll link your Discord username to your DIMO account.

#### Build Your Newsfeed from the DIMO Graph: 
- Follow [orgs](https://airtable.com/shrBX3RazvuAQ5VVS), [projects](https://airtable.com/shrhVLXNuwWrt72rt) or other [people] 
- Import existing or [template](https://airtable.com/shrCVJbBXNBOFqAs6) [Projects]
- Add [Devices](https://airtable.com/shrUhT5kjZEcJSGqF) or [Functions]

## Step 2 - Explore Knowledge Graph & Projects
- Look through some of the template projects, functions, [devices], and [organizations] on the platform.
- You can build out any part of the graph by funding a [task]! If you think of something you'd like to add to the graph, [just use this form to describe what data you need](https://airtable.com/shr5ydIkHvmPUTN5E)


## Step 3 Figure Out What You Want to Do Next
Most DIMO users fall into a few major groups, feel free to explore all of them: 

### Becoming a Curator
The best way to build some credibility in the DIMO knowledge graph is to contribute to it.

We’ve set up a series of choose-your-own-adventure missions to get you familiar with the DIMO network graph.

It’s divided into 20 minute chunks - you can typically finish the first three exercises within an hour. After the 3rd stage your work will be submitted to an admin for approval

Fill out this form. If approved, you’ll be able to submit changes to the Knowledge Graph, and participate in the [Tasks] marketplace.

### Get your First [Badge] 
This is a list of [Tasks] that are good to get started with if you’re new to DIMO. Choose one from the “Unassigned” list and get busy! Some of these tasks also carry token awards too, and you can filter down to see only those tasks.
There are also a few ongoing tasks that anyone can do anytime. Here’s one:

- Read the overview of [Events] included above and - add an event and associate it with an [org], [project], or [function] we already have on the DIMO platform. Choose something you’re interested in.
- Are you a TSLA fan? Pull in some information about their product announcements, or the [Boring Company] tunnels in Las Vegas.
- Upset about how long the I5 widening is taking (or upset that it’s even happening..) add a project update and tag [LA Metro] and [CalTrans].

### Earn or Spend Money in the [Function] Marketplace
See [functions](/objects/functions)here for an intro to the market. 

#### Wallet Setup
Sign up for a wallet using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and add your wallet address to your [person] or [org] account so you can receive incoming payments. 

- With your subscription you'll get credits each month to spend on [tasks](https://airtable.com/shrWuPpuUlE3MaTMy). 
- You can also earn credits for completing open [tasks](https://airtable.com/shrPF3YpMMleSLAPc) or contributing useful [functions](https://airtable.com/shraU5h8oNmfBAk2L)



Many tasks already have templates supported by instructional Loom videos that can be repurposed for any domain.


## Invite a Team and Start Building a [Project] together
Hopefully once you have your first DIMO contribution [badge] assigned to your account you have started to think of a couple of [Projects] that you’d like to add.

- Invite a friend or 10 to the Discord - it’s more fun to build DIMO with other people who are interested in the same things. If you are here on behalf of an organization, you can build a knowledge graph with your colleagues.
