# [Projects] 
The whole point of DIMO is to enable [Projects] that move things around. [Projects] are systems of [orgs], [people], [functions], [devices] that are designed to achieve a measurable outcome. [Deals] are a specific type of [function] that can be used to fund and build [projects] by specifying [tasks] that need to be completed to successfully launch a new instance of a [project]. 

Here’s an example of current and potential [projects] that we’re tracking.
- Automated Valet Parking System (Current)
- [The Boring Company] building a tunnel system under [Las Vegas]

Like most other DIMO [objects], [Projects] can either be a "template" or an "instance"

[Orgs] and [People] can create [Project] Templates to [display their capabilities.](https://airtable.com/shroBTjnjbWRyb0gh)
