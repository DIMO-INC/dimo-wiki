[Deals] are used to highlight and give specific information about the transactions that brought a [project] to life.


There are different methods of structuring a [Deal] 
- RFP from a Public Agency
- Private B2B contract
- Crowdfunded project or task
- Employment contract

### Issuing, Tracking & Awarding a [Deal]
Each [Deal] typically has 3 types of links to [orgs] or [people]: 

**Issuing** - The "customer" who is responsible for describing their needs, and ultimately paying for the products or services rendered in a deal.

**Tracking** - Once a [Deal] has been published, [orgs] or [people] that are interested in following it can request further details and elect to receive updates & invitations to any pre-proposal meetings that might be scheduled. 

**Awarded** - When a [deal] is closed an [org] or [person] is selected and commits to providing the services or products outlined. 



### Deal [Types]
We’ve narrowed down the different kinds of deals to the following categories:

![deal-hiring_icon.png](/dealtype/deal-hiring_icon.png) ![insurance_icon.png](/dealtype/insurance_icon.png) ![bonding_icon.png](/dealtype/bonding_icon.png) ![contract_icon.png](/dealtype/contract_icon.png) ![finance_icon.png](/dealtype/finance_icon.png) ![integration_icon.png](/dealtype/integration_icon.png)



A well-crafted [Deal] will detail **performance targets** linked to existing [functions], [devices], [orgs], and [people] working on the [project].

[Deal] information will allow for the [project] to be tracked and reviewed based upon the initial target that was put in place. 

Public and Private Sector [Orgs] can use [Deal-Templates](/Deal-Templates) as an example of how to execute a certain [project] in another location. This produces a higher degree of certainty of outcomes because it enables transparency in [deal] terms, pricing, [functions], and reputation scoring of [orgs] and [people]. 

Example: Yolo County Transportation District’s 2018 RFP [Deal] Record
- Operate their fixed route bus services, their paratransit, and explore many other transit possibilities in the area.
- Transdev ultimately won the contract and is operating their fixed routes and paratransit, while also having outlined what other potential services would look like for Yolo County.


This [deal] can easily be used for by other [orgs] to find provider [orgs] for similar [functions], understand the pricing of these deals, use a similar [deal] template, or to explore new [functions].
