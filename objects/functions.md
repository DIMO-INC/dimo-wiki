# [Functions] 

The starting point for all [Events] in the DIMO Knowledge Graph

The DIMO platform offers [Functions] for a few different purposes.  
- Automated Repeatable tasks, like data collection 
- Consultative Services like design and programming 
- Access to [devices] and other resources

Users with [verified accounts](https://airtable.com/shrCzqkLkxabwBOBR) can submit requests to [functions], which will generate [events], and sometimes [tasks] for other DIMO users. 

These functions are listed in our markatplace:

[Functions] can be bundled together and built into [projects] and [deals].
